###  Converging on dynamics plan



### update after meeting with James Feb 19:

We will bring together the existing dynamics & semantics threads to study interdisciplinary production. We will identify linguistic communities who merge, and the work that bridges them. We will compare their semantic worldviews in the context of what work comes to thrive at their intersection. We will try to understand conditions where interdisciplinary work succeeds or fails to materialize in light of comparitive semantic maps across communities.
